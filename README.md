#groupSound for Apple Music (Public)

This is a public version of groupSound for Apple Music. Source code for the iOS application and PHP API backend can be viewed.

Groupsound is a personal project I have been working on that allows users to create playlists that friends can join and add music to. It also offers the ability to listen to the playlist synchronously with those in the playlist. It allows the host to set rules that music contributions must follow, such as min/max song length, explicit allowed or not, etc.

## Current State
This was put together over a number of months and is still a WIP.

The current feature set includes:
